        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Pizza</strong>, a dish of Italian origin consisting of a flattened disk of bread dough topped with some combination of olive oil, oregano, tomato, olives, mozzarella or other cheese, and many other ingredients, baked quickly—usually, in a commercial setting, using a wood-fired oven heated to a very high temperature—and served hot.

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to the temperature specified on your pizza dough packaging (usually around 450-500°F or 232-260°C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven while it preheats.</li>

            <br>

            <li><b>Prepare the Dough:</b> On a lightly floured surface, roll out your pizza dough to your desired thickness and shape.</li>

            <br>

            <li><b>Add the Sauce:</b> Spread an even layer of pizza sauce over the dough, leaving a small border for the crust.</li>

            <br>

            <li><b>Add the Cheese:</b> Sprinkle a generous amount of mozzarella cheese over the sauce.</li>

            <br>

            <li><b>Add the Toppings:</b> Arrange your desired toppings over the cheese.</li>

            <br>

            <li><b>Bake the Pizza:</b> If you're using a pizza stone, carefully transfer the pizza onto the hot stone. Otherwise, place the pizza on a baking sheet. Bake for the time specified on your dough packaging, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly (usually 10-15 minutes).</li>

            <br>

            <li><b>Cool and Serve:</b> Let the pizza cool slightly before slicing and serving.</li>
        </ol>
